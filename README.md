# Fast-and-Compact-3D-CNN-for-HSI-Classification
This project implements a quick and efficient 3D CNN approach for the classification of HSI. The model is tested on three datasets with different geographic dimensions: PUD, SD, and IPD. These datasets provide detailed information about various types of plants and soil across different locations.
